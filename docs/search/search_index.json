Our problem \u00b6 Our first problem is relatively simple. When we first start the Code Editor, the Map UI looks like this (I've expanded the windows a bit so that the map takes up the whole display): We'd like the map to look like this: To solve this problem, we just need to find a way to change the first map so that it looks like the second one. Clicking through a solution \u00b6 If you have used Google Maps before, or any similar mapping program, then you can probably figure out how to solve this problem by clicking icons provided on the Map UI. You can use the Code Editor to try this on your own or you can try following along with me in this video: Solving this problem by clicking is fine if you only need to solve it once, but it would be pretty hard on the wrists if this was a recurring problem and we had to manually click through a solution every time we wanted to change the default map display. As we get deeper into working with Google Earth Engine, you'll likely find that more times than not, you'll want to look somewhere outside of the USA, or show a region in more or less detail than the default display, or show a region with a basemap other than the traditional Google map. So let's work out how to solve this problem with code. Representing the problem \u00b6 Let's think about what we actually did when we clicked our way through a solution. The first button I used was the pan tool. With the pan tool, when I clicked on the map and moved the mouse, the map appeared to move in the direction that the mouse moved. That effectively lets us move the map so that we could center the map on Australia. The next button I used was the zoom tool. When I clicked the + button, this made the geographic features on the map appear larger and in greater detail. This let me zoom into the harbor at Sydney. The third button I used was the basemap selection tool. This let me swap out the traditional Google Map for the Satellite image. I had to go back and forth a bit between these tools, but ultimately, I only changed three things. In other words, for our problem, we can say that the start and goal states have three conditions that differ: Condition Start Goal Center of map Over USA Over Sydney Zoom level High in sky Close to surface Base Map type Map Satellite Planning a solution \u00b6 Now let's think about how these differences represent transitions between states. What I'm after here is not how one map is different from another, but rather how one map can become a different map if we change things about it. We start with this map: If we just change the map center, we make this map: Then if we take this map and just change the zoom level, we make this map: And if we take this map and just change the basemap from Map to Satellite, then we'll end up with this map: Problem solved! Planning a solution like this is similar to creating a storyboard. The key is to focus on the transitions, on the spaces between each picture on the board. We want to identify what changes from one picture into the next, as shown in this flow diagram: This gives us a rough plan. Now we just need to identify methods in Google Earth Engine that will allow us to implement this plan. Change map center \u00b6 In the Code Editor, copy and paste this line of code and then click Run . Map . setCenter ( 151.215293 , - 33.856737 ); That should change the map so that it now looks like this. How geographic coordinates works \u00b6 Before we go much further with technical stuff, I'd like to pause and ask you if you know what the numbers represent in the code above? Can you answer these questions? Which number represents latitude and which represents longitude? Why is one of the numbers negative? What are the units of these numbers? If you don't know the answers to these questions, or aren't feeling particularly confident, then you should watch this video. insert video How the code works \u00b6 If you're brand new to writing code, here's a short video that walks you through how the code works based on the key terms in the table below. insert video Concept Definition Our example Object The thing we are trying to change Map UI Method Something we do to the object setCenter Arguments Specific details about the change we want 151.215293, -33.856737 Data Type The type of data required for the argument A number with decimals You might also notice the semicolon at the end of the line. In this case, it's not required (the code would run without it), but it's good practice to punctuate the end of a statement with a semicolon. How to find documentation \u00b6 You can use the Docs tab of the Code Editor to access documentation about any of the methods in Google Earth Engine. This video will give you a quick demo. insert video Change zoom level \u00b6 According to the documentation that we just explored, we can change the zoom level simply by adding another argument to the setCenter method. Update the code in the Code Editor with this line and then click Run . Map . setCenter ( 151.215293 , - 33.856737 , 20 ); This should make your map look like the one below. How zoom and scale work \u00b6 Let's again take a break from writing code and make sure we understand how zoom levels work. Can you answer these questions: Does a zoom level of 20 represent a large or small map scale? What are the largest and smallest possible map scales in Earth Engine? What are differences between zoom level and map scale in Earth Engine? If you're not sure or not overly confident answering these, then this video aims to help. It also shows you how to use the Inspector tool in Code Editor to quickly get information about locations on the map. insert video Change basemap \u00b6 So now let's write our second line of code. Copy and paste this code into the Code Editor and click Run . Map . setOptions ( 'SATELLITE' ); Now your map should look like the one below. Save your script \u00b6 Congrats! You're done with this step. Now would be a good time to save your code.

We'll also explore insights that can be gained by comparing change over time at multiple spatial scales. Setting Up \u00b6 Open the GEE app \u00b6 To get us started, open the app by right-clicking on the image below and opening the link in a new browser tab or window. Zoom in \u00b6 Let's zoom into the center of the map by clicking the + icon in the upper left corner. With each click, you'll zoom into a point centered on Watford City, North Dakota. The three circles represent neighborhoods around the red point that are drawn with different radii: Yellow circle represent a \u00bc mile neighborhood Orange circle represents a 1 mile neighborhood Red circle represents a 5 mile neighborhood Explore under the layers \u00b6 Change visible layers \u00b6 With the layers button on the map, uncheck the bottom three layers so that the only visible layers are the \u00bc mile circle and the point of interest. Then zoom in a little more so that you can see some details in the Satellite basemap. Interpret land cover within \u00bc mile neighborhood \u00b6 Take a moment to try to answer the question below. Then click on the question to compare thoughts. Describe the land cover you see within the 1/4 mile circle It might be hard to think of a place in North Dakota as \"urban,\" but the land cover in this 1/4 mile neighborhood has qualities that are urban in character. If you really zoom in, you'll recognize roads, parking lots, driveways, rooftops, cars, etc. You'll also see yards and trees. You can probably imagine the land uses associated with these patterns of land cover: residential streets and a commercial center. Compare landcover within 1 mile neighborhood \u00b6 Now make the 1 mile circle the only layer visible and look at the land cover in this neighborhood. You'll likely need to zoom out a little bit to fit the circle in the map window. Try to answer the question below. Then click on it to compare thoughts. How does landcover within 1 mile of the city center differ from landcover within 1/4 mile? There's more variation in landcover within the bigger circle. There are some cultivated lands and wetlands in this neighborhood. There's also dense \"strip\" development along the main roads and some industrial development (for example, in the north area). Compare landcover within 5 mile neighborhood \u00b6 Now investigate the 5 mile radius circle and try to answer the question below. Then click on it when you're ready to compare thoughts. How does landcover within 5 miles of the city center differ from landcover within the other circles? In the largest circle, the majority of land appears to be agricultural. There's also a very noticeable pattern of bare rectangles within the agricultural lands that seem to be associated with secondary roads. Investigate change across scales \u00b6 Interpret the chart \u00b6 OK, so now that we've investigated how land cover differs within each of our circles, let's look at the chart in the app that shows how each of these neighborhoods changed over the extent of the data record. Take a look at the chart and then try to answer the three questions below. What's similar about the way all three lines change and what do you think causes this? Beginning in 2010, all three neighborhoods show an abrupt increase in brightness. This marks the start of the fracking boom, which brought more people to the town. This likely encouraged more commercial development. It also brought development of fracking infrastructure around the town and scattered along secondary roads. Why are the yellow and orange so similar in the way that they change? The yellow line is always a little higher than the orange, which makes sense since we saw that the orange circle included more of a mix of urban and agricultural lands. It also suggests something about the size of Watford City. The two lines are close and this suggests the size of the city is not quite two miles across, but nearly so. Why does the red line differ from the other two lines? This shows that the nearby area outside of the city was largely rural with few lights at the beginning of the record. With the fracking boom, the visibility of lights in rural lands near the city increased quite rapidly. This could be from some increased urban development (commercial and residential) and also from the development of gas fields near the city (those rectangular patches of bare ground along secondary roads). Explore nearby locations outside of the city \u00b6 Let's explore a location outside of Watford City. I zoomed out a bit and then clicked on another location to the southwest of Watford City. By clicking, the app updated the chart so that now it shows changes in the three neighborhoods around this new point. Look at this chart and then try to answer the questions below. Why do the three lines lie on top of each other for all the years prior to 2010? This suggests that this whole area was agricultural land (with very few sources of lights at night) until about 2010. At this time, the development from fracking began in the region. Why do the yellow and orange lines depart from the red line after 2010? This suggests that development was more concentrated here. By about 2012, the neighborhood within 1 mile of this location began to develop more intensively than the land within 5 miles. Explore a different region \u00b6 Use the app to explore different locations. In the Google's Search bar in the top banner of the app, type in \"Frisco, TX, USA\". Then click on the center of the map so that the app updates the chart for this location. Try to answer the questions below. What does the chart tell you about the way Frisco, TX changed ? You tell me :). Now search for \"Plano, TX, USA\" and click in the center of the map to update the chart. What does the chart tell you about the way Plano, TX changed and how do these changes differ from Frisco? You tell me :). Now search for \"Westfalls Village, Frisco, TX, USA\" and click on the center of the map to update the chart. What does the chart tell you about the way Westfalls Village has changed and how do these changes differ from the other two places we've looked at in Texas? You tell me :). Explore on your own \u00b6 Go ahead and use the app to explore how other places in the world have changed. Try to identify at least one other place where looking at changes across neighborhood scales is particularly insightful.","title":"How do changes in lights over time compare across spatial observation scales?"},{"location":"lights/questions/changeScaleTime/#objectives","text":"In this lesson, we'll explore how the scale of spatial observations influence measurements of change over time.

Beginning in 2010, all three neighborhoods show an abrupt increase in brightness. This marks the start of the fracking boom, which brought more people to the town. This likely encouraged more commercial development. It also brought development of fracking infrastructure around the town and scattered along secondary roads. Why are the yellow and orange so similar in the way that they change? The yellow line is always a little higher than the orange, which makes sense since we saw that the orange circle included more of a mix of urban and agricultural lands. It also suggests something about the size of Watford City. The two lines are close and this suggests the size of the city is not quite two miles across, but nearly so. Why does the red line differ from the other two lines? This shows that the nearby area outside of the city was largely rural with few lights at the beginning of the record. With the fracking boom, the visibility of lights in rural lands near the city increased quite rapidly. This could be from some increased urban development (commercial and residential) and also from the development of gas fields near the city (those rectangular patches of bare ground along secondary roads).","title":"Interpret the chart"},{"location":"lights/questions/changeScaleTime/#explore-nearby-locations-outside-of-the-city","text":"Let's explore a location outside of Watford City. I zoomed out a bit and then clicked on another location to the southwest of Watford City. By clicking, the app updated the chart so that now it shows changes in the three neighborhoods around this new point. Look at this chart and then try to answer the questions below. Why do the three lines lie on top of each other for all the years prior to 2010? This suggests that this whole area was agricultural land (with very few sources of lights at night) until about 2010. At this time, the development from fracking began in the region. Why do the yellow and orange lines depart from the red line after 2010? This suggests that development was more concentrated here. By about 2012, the neighborhood within 1 mile of this location began to develop more intensively than the land within 5 miles.","title":"Explore nearby locations outside of the city"},{"location":"lights/questions/changeScaleTime/#explore-a-different-region","text":"Use the app to explore different locations.
