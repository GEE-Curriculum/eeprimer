I'm interested in using Earth Engine to introduce students to foundations of cartography, raster GIS, and remote sensing. This primer is a means to these ends. I teach undergraduate students at a liberal arts college. Most of my students have no experience writing or reading code. Most have experience as consumers of geographic information (they use Google maps to travel), but don't know much about how to produce maps and geographic information. Many also know little about physical geography and how earth systems work. So while developing this content, I'm trying to remember what it's like to know nothing, but to be interested by everything.

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to: define a default base map query attributes of a location identify which number in the code above refers to latitude and which one refers to longitude discern if the zoom level in this code represents a small or large scale map interpret how many digits are significant for representing a coordinate location at different scales set the default scale and extent of a map To get started, you'll need to Start the Code Editor .","title":"Objectives"},{"location":"projects/cart/02-base-map/02-change-base-map/","text":"1. Start with a blank slate \u00b6 Let's start clean so that we can see what our code does one line at a time. Go ahead and reload the Code Editor (you can click here ).

Explore the UI controls \u00b6 UI is a short way of saying \"User Interface,\" which is a short way of saying \"stuff the program lets you interact with\". In the upper right of the Map window, you'll see two buttons that allow you to toggle the base map. If you click around on these buttons, you'll see you can change the base map that gets displayed. You should have four options: Map Terrain (depicts mountains) Satellite Satellite with labels unchecked 3. Set the base map \u00b6 Let's change the base map so that it displays the Satellite image without the labels. Copy and paste this code into the Editor and then click Run . Map . setOptions ( 'SATELLITE' ); Your map should now display the Satellite base map and look like this: 4. Find documentation \u00b6 Let's look at how this code works. To start, let's look at the API documentation that Google provides through the Code Editor. Look in the panel on the upper left of the Code Editor and click on the Docs tab. In the search box, type setOption . This should filter the documentation list so that it only shows methods that contain the phrase \"setOption\". Let's click on the item that we used in our code: Map.setOptions . You should get this documentation: 5. How to read documentation \u00b6 How the code works \u00b6 If you're brand new to writing code, then let's take a moment to talk through how it works. There are four key concepts at play here: An object that we're working with. A method applied to the object. An argument for the method. A data type for the argument. In our code, we call on the Map object , apply the .setOption method , provide the SATELLITE argument in parentheses, and define the string data type with single quotes. You might also notice the semicolon at the end of the line. In this case, it's not required (the code would run without it), but it's good practice to punctuate the end of a statement with a semicolon.
