To access the Code Editor you'll need to open up a web browser (I use [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)).

To access the Code Editor with the browser, you can either:

- click [here](https://code.earthengine.google.com/)  
- type "https://code.earthengine.google.com/" as the web address
- type key words "code Earth Engine" in a searth engine (like [Google](https://www.google.com/)).

These three options should all get you to the same place, which should look like this:
