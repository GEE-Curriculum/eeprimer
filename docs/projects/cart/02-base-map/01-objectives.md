The image below shows a plane on a runway of the Haneda Airport in Tokyo, Japan.

If you copy the two lines of code below and paste them in the Code Editor, you should be able to see the same Lufthansa plane on the tarmac.

```JavaScript
Map.setOptions('SATELLITE');
Map.setCenter(139.801091, 35.545384, 20);
```

This lesson will walk you through how this code works.  

By the end of this lesson, you should be able to:

- define a default base map
- query attributes of a location
- identify which number in the code above refers to latitude and which one refers to longitude
- discern if the zoom level in this code represents a small or large scale map
- interpret how many digits are significant for representing a coordinate location at different scales
- set the default scale and extent of a map

To get started, you'll need to [Start the Code Editor](../../getting-started/02-start-code-editor.md).
