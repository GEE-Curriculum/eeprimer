The primer builds on a premise that using Earth Engine involves understanding three main things.  

### How to ask questions

In the first section, we focus on fundamental questions that you can ask with Earth Engine. In these lessons, you'll explore GEE **apps** that we've written to try to get you thinking about what you can learn about the world with geographic datasets. The aim here is to learn basic methods of geographic inquiry without getting bogged down with learning to write code at the same time.

### How to implement methods  

In the second section, we provide sets of tutorials that walk you through how to implement methods that we used to process the data in our apps. These lessons involve using GEE's **Code Editor** to write and execute code. The aim here is to learn fundamental Earth Engine methods that will enable you to develop your own custom analyses.

### How to share work

In the third section, we provide sets of tutorials that walk you through methods for creating apps with the Code Editor. This will enable you to create custom apps and share your work with people who don't have access to Earth Engine or know how to use it.
