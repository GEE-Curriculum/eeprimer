**Audience:** Undergraduate  
**Level:** Beginner  
**Duration:** 90 minutes  


This lesson explores how a map displays information about something big and round (the Earth) on something small and flat (your computer screen).  

We'll use the Code Editor and the Map User Interface (UI) in Google Earth Engine to explore a simple paradox of cartography: in order to represent space, a map distorts space.

We'll explore how the map used in Google Earth Engine  to visualize datasets misrepresents space in a number of ways: making some points that are near each other on Earth appear to be further away on the map, making the shortest routes between two points on Earth appear to bend circuitously on the map, and making some regions appear to be much larger than they really are.

By the end of the lesson, you should be able to do several things with Google Earth Engine's Code Editor:
 * Change the base layer and scale of the map.
 * Draw a line that represents the great circle path between two points ([like this][image01]).
 * Draw a set of regularly spaced circles that each represent the same area on the surface of the Earth yet appear to increase in size as you increase in latitude. ([like this][image02]).

Technically, you will learn to:
* work in the Code Editor
* work with the Map UI
* work with geometries, features, and feature collections
* apply methods to geometries and features
* write a function and map the function across a feature collection

This lesson is for beginners, however, you need to have completed the **Getting started with Earth Engine** before you can start this lesson.
