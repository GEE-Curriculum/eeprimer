I'm writing this Primer with two main audiences in mind.  

### For Students
The Primer is for students, or anyone who wants to learn more about working with geographic datasets using Google Earth Engine. I teach undergraduate students at a liberal arts college who may have little to no experience with one or more of the following:

* writing or reading code
* using a geographic information system (GIS)    
* how earth systems work

So I try to provide support in these three areas, in addition to providing instruction on how Google Earth Engine works.

### For Teachers

The Primer is also for teachers, or anyone who wants to learn about ways of teaching other people how to work with geographic datasets using Google Earth Engine. I hope the Primer might help provide other teachers with two things:  

* **content** that can be used or adapted in their own teachings
* **strategies** for presenting or structuring instruction that foster active learning
