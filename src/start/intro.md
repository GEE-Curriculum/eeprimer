If you don't have an account with Google Earth Engine yet, this section will try to help get you set up so that you can work through the content in this Primer. While Earth Engine is quite powerful, there are times when I like to do some tasks with [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/), so I've also (or will soon also) include some information to help you get set up with this open-source GIS software, if you aren't already familiar with it.
