If you don't have an account with Google Earth Engine yet, this section will try to help get you set up so that you can work through the content in this Primer.

## Sign up  

To be able to use Google Earth Engine, you'll need to sign up for an account. Here are the steps:  

1. Go to https://earthengine.google.com/.
2. In the upper right of the screen, you'll see a **Sign Up** button. Click on it and follow the directions.
3. You will need to use a registered Google account to sign up.  

After you complete your registration, it can take a few days for folks at Google to approve your request. You should receive a confirmation email at the account that you used to sign up.

## Start the Code editor  

After Google folks approve your sign up request, you'll access the Code Editor through a web browser. I find that [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) works well and I will be using Chrome in all of the workflows and examples shown in this Primer.

To start the code editor in a browser window, go to this address: https://code.earthengine.google.com/

You might as well bookmark the page so that you can return to it easily.

## Navigate the Code Editor  

Here's a diagram from the [Google Developer's Guide](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/playground) that shows the layout of the Code Editor.
