After Google folks approve your sign up request, you'll access the Code Editor through a web browser. I find that [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) works well and I will be using Chrome in all of the workflows and examples shown in this Primer.

To start the code editor in a browser window, go to this address: https://code.earthengine.google.com/

You might as well bookmark the page so that you can return to it easily.
