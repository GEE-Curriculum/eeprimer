To be able to use Google Earth Engine, you'll need to sign up for an account. Here are the steps:  

1. Go to https://earthengine.google.com/.
2. In the upper right of the screen, you'll see a **Sign Up** button. Click on it and follow the directions.
3. You will need to use a registered Google account to sign up.  

After you complete your registration, it can take a few days for folks at Google to approve your request. You should receive a confirmation email at the account that you used to sign up.
