We will use the [Earth Engine Code Editor](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/playground) to work with a global dataset of [Nighttime Lights](https://eogdata.mines.edu/products/dmsp/) and make a new map layer (shown below) that visualizes changes nighttime lights between 1993, 2003, and 2013.
