This is a work in progress.

I'm interested in using Earth Engine to introduce students to foundations of cartography, raster GIS, and remote sensing. This primer is a means to these ends.

I teach undergraduate students at a liberal arts college. Most of my students have no experience writing or reading code. Most have experience as consumers of geographic information (they use Google maps to travel), but don't know much about how to produce maps and geographic information. Many also know little about physical geography and how earth systems work. So while developing this content, I'm trying to remember what it's like to know nothing, but to be interested by everything.
