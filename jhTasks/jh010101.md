### Change the base map

Let's start working with the base map. In the upper right of the Map window, you'll see two buttons that allow you to toggle the base map.

Click the Map button to set the base map to the familiar Google map. Now write this line of code.

```javascript
Map.setOptions('SATELLITE');
```
Click Run. Your map should now display the Satellite base map.

#### How the code works

If you're brand new to writing code, then let's take a moment to talk through how it works. There are four key concepts at play here:

> An **object** that we're working with.  
> A **method** applied to the object.  
> An **argument** for the method.  
> A **data type** for the argument.   

In our code, we call on the *Map* **object**, apply the *.setOption* **method**, provide the  *SATELLITE* **argument** in parentheses, and define the *string* **data type** with single quotes.

You might also notice the semicolon at the end of the line. In this case, it's not required (the code would run without it), but it's good practice to punctuate the end of a statement with a semicolon.

#### Practice

Here's a list of the base maps that Google provides:
> ROADMAP  
> SATELLITE  
> HYBRID  
> TERRAIN  

Try changing the argument in our code to display the base map that looks like this:
